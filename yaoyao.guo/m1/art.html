		<h1>The Portal of Rouen Cathedral in Morning Light</h1>
		<h2>The Rouen Cathedral series was painted in the 1890s by French impressionist Claude Monet. The paintings in the series each capture the facade of the Rouen Cathedral at different times of the day and year and reflect changes in its appearance under different lighting conditions.</h2>

		<p><b>Title: The Portal of Rouen Cathedral in Morning Light<br>Artist/Maker: Claude Monet (French, 1840 - 1926)<br>Culture: French<br> Place: France (Place Created)<br>Date: 1894<br>Medium: Oil on canvas<br>Object Number: 2001.33<br>Dimensions: 100.3 X 65.1 cm (39 1/2 X 25 5/8 in.)</b><br><br>"Everything changes, even stone." <b><i>Claude Monet</i></b> wrote these words in a letter and vividly demonstrated them in paint, conveying a wondrous combination of permanence and mutability as the sun daily transformed the facade of Rouen Cathedral. Extending the building's encrusted stone surface to the richly varied impasto surface of his painting, he portrayed the cathedral perpetually re-emerging in the suffused light of early morning.<br><br>Monet created several groups of paintings exploring the color, light, and form of a single subject at various times of day, but his Rouen Cathedral series was his most intense effort on a single site. He painted there in late winter in both 1892 and 1893, then reworked his thirty canvases from memory in the studio through 1894. He began this example in 1893, working in an improvised studio in the front room of a dressmaker's shop across from the cathedral.<br><br>After creating a coherent ensemble, Monet selected twenty paintings that he considered "complete" and "perfect," including this one, for an exhibition at his Paris dealer's gallery in May 1895. Pissarro and Cezanne visited and praised the series, and patrons quickly purchased eight paintings from the group.The Rouen Cathedral paintings, more than thirty in all, were made in 1892 and 1893 in Rouen, Normandy, then reworked in Monet's studio in 1894. Monet rented spaces in Rouen across the street from the cathedral as his temporary studio. In 1895 he selected what he considered to be the twenty best paintings from the series for display at his Paris dealer's gallery and sold eight of them before the exhibition was over. Camille Pissarro and Paul Cezanne visited the exhibition and praised the series highly.<br><br>Historically, the series was well-timed. In the early 1890s, France was seeing a revival of interest in Catholicism and the subject of one of its major cathedrals was well received.Apart from its religious significance, Rouen Cathedral-built in the Gothic style-could be seen as representing all that was best in French history and culture, given that it was a style of architecture that was admired and adopted by many European countries during the Middle Ages.<br></p>
