            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>My website is for people who love Japanese culture to purchase small and cute goods from Tokyo. It’s a website that sells my collection that I brought back when I was traveling in Japan. </p>
            <p>I am sure that we are all happened to be obsessed with different cultures. We all have a collection of things we brought during a trip that we think it’s meaningful. It’s such an exciting moment to share my memory with others. </p>
